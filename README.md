# dargaCode Portfolio Site

<strong>Language: HTML/CSS/JS</strong>

I'm working on this site very gradually, and using it to learn/incorporate best practices for HTML/CSS/JS. That said, I also want to keep things very vanilla and avoid installing frameworks etc.

**To-Do:**

- Improved accessibility
- Custom 404 page
- A few more small JS features.
- Bundled/minified code
- Analytics
- SEO
