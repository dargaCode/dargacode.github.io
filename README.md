# dargaCode Portfolio Site
<strong>Language: HTML/CSS/JS</strong>

I'm working on this site very gradually, and using it to learn/incorporate best practices for HTML/CSS/JS. That said, I also want to keep things very vanilla and avoid installing frameworks etc.

**To-Do:**
* Responsiveness
* Mobile support
* Improved accessibility
* Custom 404 page
* A few more small JS features.
* Bundled/minified code
* Analytics
* SEO
